<h1> Automated Hyperparameter Optimization Using AutoML Techniques </h1>

**Overview**
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of an automated hyperparameter optimization (HPO) system using AutoML techniques. The system aims to efficiently identify the best hyperparameter configurations for various machine learning models and datasets, significantly improving their performance.

**Contents**

*AutoML Techniques.ipynb*:

This Jupyter notebook includes the implementation of the automated HPO system. It demonstrates the application of advanced AutoML techniques, such as Bayesian optimization, random forests, and Tree-Parzen Estimator (TPE), to optimize hyperparameters for different machine learning models.

*Random search vs Submitted model vs Hyperopt scores.ipynb*:

This Jupyter notebook provides a comparative analysis of different HPO methods, including random search, the submitted model, and Hyperopt. It includes detailed evaluation metrics such as ROC AUC, cross-validation scores, and learning rate distribution curves.

*AutoML.ipynb*:

This Jupyter notebook is simply combination of the above two files. The above two files are integrated in such a way that the results of those two files can be obtained from here.

*AutoML.pdf*: 

This PDF report provides a comprehensive overview of the project, detailing the problem statement, system design and implementation, evaluation metrics, results and discussion, and conclusions. It also includes an analysis of the performance of the hyperparameter optimization techniques implemented in the Jupyter notebooks.
